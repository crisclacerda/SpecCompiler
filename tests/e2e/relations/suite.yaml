# - vc_rel_002_xref.md     -> VC-REL-002 (Cross-Reference Resolution)
# - vc_rel_003_citations.md -> VC-REL-003 (Citation Cross References)
# - vc_rel_004_scoped_resolution.md -> VC-REL-004 (Scoped/normalized relation resolution)
# - vc_rel_005_attribute_scope_prefixes.md -> VC-REL-005 (Attribute links, scoped floats, alias and ambiguity handling)
# - vc_rel_006_scoped_label_resolution.md -> VC-REL-006 (Scoped # label resolution, closest-to-global)
# - vc_rel_007_section_xrefs.md -> VC-REL-007 (Section cross-references via @ PID and # label)
