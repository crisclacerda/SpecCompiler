## Test Execution Matrix

This matrix is autogenerated from VC objects and relations in Spec-IR during rendering.
Do not manually maintain matrix rows in this document.

## Traceability Matrix

### Deterministic Enforcement in VERIFY

- `traceability_vc_to_hlr`: VC must trace to at least one HLR.
- `traceability_tr_to_vc`: TR must trace to at least one VC.
- `traceability_hlr_to_vc`: HLR must be covered by at least one VC (when VCs exist).
- `traceability_fd_to_csc`: FD must trace to at least one CSC when CSC entries exist.
- `traceability_fd_to_csu`: FD must trace to at least one CSU when CSU entries exist.

Projects control severity via `project.yaml` `validation` policy (`error`, `warn`, `ignore`) without custom check scripts.
TP filename-to-VC mapping is also enforced by the test runner naming convention (`vc_*_<seq>_*.md`).
