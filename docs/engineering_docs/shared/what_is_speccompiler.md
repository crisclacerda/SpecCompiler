## What is SpecCompiler?

SpecCompiler is a document processing [TERM-15](@) that transforms structured Markdown specifications into multiple output formats (DOCX, HTML5). It provides:

- **Structured authoring**: Define requirements, designs, and verification cases using a consistent syntax
- **Traceability**: Link objects together with `@PID` and `#label` references
- **Validation**: Automatically verify data integrity through proof views
- **Multi-format output**: Generate Word documents and web content from a single source

SpecCompiler processes documents through a five-phase pipeline: [TERM-19](@), [TERM-20](@), [TERM-22](@), [TERM-21](@), and [TERM-23](@).
